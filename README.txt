# Self-tuning Model Predictive Control for Wake Flows

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for the application of model predictive control (MPC) with control parameters identified through Bayesian optimization. The control plant used is the chaotic wake of the fluidic pinball at Reynolds number Re = 150. The plant model is obtained using the SINDYc technique. Control is applied for drag reduction and lift stabilization, considering the challenge of measurement noise in control sensors. Noise mitigation is achieved using the Local Polynomial Regression technique.

## Key Features

- MPC with Bayesian optimization for parameter identification.
- SINDYc technique for plant model estimation.
- Control for drag reduction and lift stabilization for chaotic fluidic pinball wake
- Local Polynomial Regression for noise mitigation.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- R (for execution of .R scripts)
- R package: lokern


## Instructions

The code is written in MATLAB.

For certain functionalities, R is required.

1. Install R: [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Install RStudio (optional but recommended): [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. Identify the path to `Rscript.exe`.
4. Open the Matlab function 'SetUp.m' and paste the Rscript.exe path where specified
5. Run the MATLAB script 'SetUp.m'
6. Run the code 'MPC_main.m'
7. ...ENJOY!


Part of the code was implemented based on the MPC code of the article:

dynamics for model predictive control in the low-data limit.

--------------------
If the installation of the 'lokern' package fails, you can manually run the following command in R or Rstudio:

    ---
    install.packages("lokern")
    ---
